- 👋 Hi, I’m @sammyb1rd
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, programming, data science/analysis, development, and the whole world of software, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very basics/foundation. I've just started the Odin Project and I'm very excited about it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...learning foundations? At this point, I do not know enough to say what I'm looking to collarborate on it this point.
- 📫 How to reach me: is there messaging on github? perhaps on discord? still figuring it all out.
